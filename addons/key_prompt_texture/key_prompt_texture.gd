## Adapts the texture displayed based on the currently connected controller.
## Useful for button prompts in UI elements.
##
## Will search for a valid icon to display based on the first connected controller, and fall back to a default
## if the type of the main connected controller is not supported by the plugin.
## If no controller is connected, an optional "None" texture can be shown (for example, a keyboard prompt for a desktop game).
## [br]The textures used by [KeyPromptTexture]s can be changed by replacing or adding files in the [code]res://addons/key_prompt_texture/textures/JOY_BUTTON_*[/code]
## folders.
## [br]To configure the mapping of [url=https://github.com/gabomdq/SDL_GameControllerDB/blob/master/gamecontrollerdb.txt]controller names[/url]
## to textures, edit [code]res://addons/key_prompt_texture/controller_name_mappings.json[/code].
## When editing or creating these high-level mappings,
## use the name of a general class of controllers as the JSON key,
## and an array of regular expressions which will be used to match device names (as provided by [method Input.get_joy_name]) as the value.
## [br]"None" in a device name entry will cause the associated key to be used when no controller is connected,
## whereas "Default" will configure what is used to handle all unknown controllers.
## [br]Changes to this file are necessary to change the types of controller for which icons will be handled by [KeyPromptTexture] in the current project.
## [br][br]Joypad axes such as LT are not currently supported.
