# Key Prompt Texture
![Key Prompt Texture Demo](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1yeSddI0Pejf1Svljc7a9eqq3N_i9ymgp)

This plugin allows showing a different texture depending on the currently connected controller through the `KeyPromptTexture` class.
## Key Prompt Configuration:
Editing `controller_name_mappings.json` allows one to change how devices are mapped to the textures displayed.
The textures themselves can be found and changed under `res://addons/key_prompt_texture/textures`.
Details can also be found in the class documentation for `KeyPromptTexture`.
## Localization:
Different button prompts can be shown in different locales by using Godot's [asset remapping tool](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/i18n/internationalizing_games.html#localizing-icons-and-images) on the base key prompt images.
